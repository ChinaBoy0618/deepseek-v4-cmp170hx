# Patches

Against [haosdent/vllm@dsv4-flash-a100](https://github.com/haosdent/vllm/tree/dsv4-flash-a100)
(commit `f8ea5bb`). Apply with `patch -p1` from the vLLM checkout root.

The container installs vLLM with `pip install -e .`, so `/vllm/vllm/...` inside the image is
live source. You can therefore apply these by **bind-mounting the patched files** instead of
rebuilding — which is what [`launch/run-pp-dspark.sh`](../launch/run-pp-dspark.sh) does.

| # | file | what | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0001 | `model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer.py` | add the missing `has_device_capability(90)` gate to `use_persistent_topk` | **Correctness, not speed.** Without it sm_80 selects a radix top-k kernel that returns wrong indices when the candidate count falls between k and 2k — with `index_topk=512` and `compress_ratio=4` that is **prompt length 2049–4096**. It does not crash; it emits fluent-looking degenerate text. Reported by another CMP 170HX owner in vllm#50576. |
| 0002 | `config/speculative.py` | `draft_parallel_config.pipeline_parallel_size = 1` for dspark | The DSpark draft is **not** pipelined — the model runner builds it on the last PP rank only and it runs there whole. Inheriting the target's PP size makes `verify_with_parallel_config` demand `SupportsPP` from the *draft* architecture, which it neither implements nor needs. |
| 0003 | `v1/worker/gpu/pp_utils.py` | add `broadcast_draft()`, the matching receive, and sampled-token padding | This is **vLLM PR #46994**, which is not in upstream main. Without it, non-last pipeline ranks verify against a zero-initialised `req_states.draft_tokens` — acceptance near zero and corrupt output. The padding matters too: the receiver always posts a `max_sample_len`-wide buffer, so an unpadded narrow send is an element-count mismatch that deadlocks. |
| 0004 | `v1/worker/gpu/model_runner.py` | drop the dspark PP guard; call `broadcast_draft()` after `propose()`; scatter relayed draft tokens on non-last ranks | The guard covered eagle3/dflash/dspark; only dspark is enabled here — the other two are untested and their aux layers are spread across ranks rather than landing on one. |
| 0005 | `v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/dspark/utils.py` | drop `NotImplementedError("DSpark does not support pipeline parallelism.")`; add `_has_real_weight()`; load the draft's token embedding from the checkpoint | Under PP the target's `embed_tokens` is a `PPMissingLayer` on the drafter's rank — and **aliasing one is a silent no-op, not an error**, hence the explicit check. The embedding (~1 GB) is read straight from `embed.weight` in the checkpoint, which avoids adding a cross-rank collective to model load. |

## Why DSpark-on-PP works at all

The model runner **already** builds the speculator on the last pipeline rank only:

```python
if self.is_last_pp_rank:
    self.speculator = init_speculator(self.vllm_config, self.device)
```

And the layer arithmetic cooperates. DeepSeek-V4-Flash has 43 layers; over PP4 they split:

```
rank 0: layers  0..10      rank 2: layers 22..32
rank 1: layers 11..21      rank 3: layers 33..42
```

DSpark taps `dspark_target_layer_ids = [40, 41, 42]` for its auxiliary hidden states, and
`lm_head` also lives on the last rank. **All three land on rank 3, together with the
drafter.** Only the token embedding (rank 0) is stranded, which patch 0005 handles.

That alignment is what makes this five small patches rather than a rewrite. It is specific to
this model and this PP degree — a different layer count or a different `dspark_target_layer_ids`
could put the aux taps on a rank that has neither the drafter nor `lm_head`, and then the
auxiliary hidden states would need relaying across ranks too.

## Three guards, not one

Worth knowing if you port this further — they were found one at a time, and the third is the
one that costs an afternoon because its message blames the wrong model:

1. `v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/dspark/utils.py` — `NotImplementedError: DSpark does not support pipeline parallelism.`
2. `v1/worker/gpu/model_runner.py` — `ValueError: {method} with pipeline parallel is not supported.`
3. `config/model.py` — `NotImplementedError: Pipeline parallelism is not supported for this model. Supported models implement the SupportsPP interface.` This fires at **config** time, on the **draft** architecture, and reads like a problem with the target model.
